                                          Parcels you send outside of Canada need go through the receiving country’s customs process. Once a package is in customs:

                                          Times for packages to clear customs vary. Delays can occur due to the package itself, its documentation or the volume of packages in customs at the time.

                                               <div class="faq_answer"> Ans:) The PERMANENT™ stamp, identified with the letter P in place of a value, is always accepted at the current domestic postage price. If you buy a PERMANENT stamp today, you can use it anytime in the future.

                                                   One PERMANENT stamp can be used to mail a letter (weighing up to 30 grams) anywhere in Canada. You can also use PERMANENT stamps in conjunction with additional postage to mail larger letters, parcels or to send mail internationally. </div>
